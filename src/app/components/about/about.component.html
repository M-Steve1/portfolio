            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Stephen, a Software Engineer who loves building dynamic applications. I recently developed an e-commerce web app using JavaScript/TypeScript, node.js, Angular, and PostgresSQL. I am passionate about programming. I'd love to combine my passion for learning with my skill in web development to continue building web applications for people. I have worked with the following programming languages JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, Python and C.
                Aside from programming I also love playing video game, my favorites are FIFA and Call of Duty.
